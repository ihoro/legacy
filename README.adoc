# legacy

My personal nostalgia - projects and snippets since the 90s. Not everything
survived and not every piece can be published. Correct file creation or change
timestamps are lost, but, fortunately, sometimes I used comments with a date
or a year within code itself. Something was created before I started to use
any VCS, but most of the stuff came from old Subversion repositories I found
in my archives.

## appxxn

It was a great help for my team mates what saved nerves and man-hours a lot.
IDA Pro and my favourite OllyDbg were used here.

## avg

Some play with Microsoft COM technology, as I remember.

## ays

ays - Are You Sure?
Some simple program to shutdown, reboot or log off. It was usually binded to
some special keys on my keyboard.

## _balderdash

Not related to software development directly, but it's about some kind of
programming. It was a design of additional game zone for one of MUD worlds,
called Baslderdash. The idea was to help newbies and cover directions to other
zones by talking to an old traveller and listening to his stories.
I guess that world exists still, somewhere at balderdash.ru.

## bmp2array

I do not remember why I needed such a silly conversion :)

## bnu_control

Another navigation hardware related tool.

## bugger

It was a small bookmarklet what helped developers & QA to deal with chore
actions within specific issue tracking system. As I remember it was Eventum
from Sun Microsystems.

## comstuff

It was communicating with specific navigation related hardware via UART (COM) port.

## cutcomments

Yes, it cuts comments from a C/C++ source code file.

## df

Some data parsing tool used for implementation and work with specific navigation
hardware.  It reminds me that NMEA standard is involved here.

## ffc

FF Catcher. It was a tool implemented for engineers who were working on design
and implementation of navigation hardware. It communicates with specific
hardware via UART (COM) port. And it's based on usual Win32 GUI.

## flines

HTML/CSS & JavaScript based implementation of a well known game "Lines".

## flinx

I guess it was a play with Java Swing, some simple GUI program about favourite
web links.

## f_mixer

It was a changed version of built-in FreeBSD mixer program. I changed its output
what was used by Conky on my desktop to show audio levels.

## ix85

It looks I had an idea to build some lib by gathering together repeating code
in my asm based programs. It looks, according to its small code base, it did not
happen :)

## kli

kli - keyboard layout indicator.
As I remember it was the time of counting each MB of your RAM :) And I do not
remember why, but default Windows' indicator was not good enough. And some
third party software like Keyboard Ninja (is it a correct name?) was quite a
memory consumer. And such a tiny 5 KB executable was funny to have. So,
probably the key idea behind this project was learning and "why not?" :-D

## mmh

It was time when I liked to close windows in MS Windows using my mouse middle
button :)

## pcalc

Calculates something, but who remembers what. And it's hard to guess from that
cryptic asm code.

## rcheck

I do not remember what it does, it looks I was not intended to be its user.

## runmax

Runs a program with Win GUI window maximized.

## se

se - script executor.
Talks to specific navigation hardware via UART (COM) port, receives respective
responses and builds a report. Its primary use was navigation hardware testing.

## sleep

I guess it was used in a big project for some bat files logic.

## stp_proto

It was named after FTP. It was a project to learn networking. It provides a server
what can serve a given directory and a client who can connect to it, traverse
directory structure and download files from remote sever. It was 2005's, I guess.

## updater23x, updater24x

I guess it was something unfinished or not used much. And it was about updating
programs like patching or something.

## vbsfilter

A Doxygen filter to support ASP code documentation. It was created to help with
docs generation on a commercial project. As I remember, I intentionally decided
to build it with Perl, just to learn Perl a little. Well, it's fun, but... the
resulting code is quite cryptic :)
