# legacy

My personal nostalgia - projects and snippets since the 90s. Not everything
survived and not every piece can be published. Correct file creation or change
timestamps are lost, but, fortunately, sometimes I used comments with a date
or a year within code itself. Something was created before I started to use
any VCS, but most of the stuff came from old Subversion repositories I found
in my archives.

## avg

Some play with Microsoft COM technology, as I remember.

## ays

ays - Are You Sure?
Some simple program to shutdown, reboot or log off. It was usually binded to
some special keys on my keyboard.

## df

Some data parsing tool used for implementation and work with specific navigation
hardware.  It reminds me taht NMEA standard is involved here.

## ffc

FF Catcher. It was a tool implemented for engineers who were working on design
and implementation of navigation hardware. It communicates with specific
hardware via UART (COM) port. And it's based on usual Win32 GUI.

## ix85

It looks I had an idea to build some lib by gathering together repeating code
in my asm based programs. It looks, according to its small code base, it did not
happen :)

## kli

kli - keyboard layout indicator.
As I remember it was the time of counting each MB of your RAM :) And I do not
remember why, but default Windows' indicator was not good enough. And some
third party software like Keyboard Ninja (is it a correct name?) was quite a
memory consumer. And such a tiny 5 KB executable was funny to have. So,
probably the key idea behind this project was learning and "why not?" :-D

## pcalc

Calculates something, but who remembers what. And it's hard to guess from that
cryptic asm code.

## rcheck

I do not remember what it does, it looks I was not intended to be its user.

## runmax

Runs a program with Win GUI window maximized.

## se

se - script executor.
Talks to specific navigation hardware via UART (COM) port, receives respective
responses and builds a report. Its primary use was navigation hardware testing.

## sleep

I guess it was used in a big project for some bat files logic.

## updater23x, updater24x

I guess it was something unfinished or not used much. And it was about updating
programs like patching or something.

## vbsfilter

A Doxygen filter to support ASP code documentation. It was created to help with
docs generation on a commercial project. As I remember, I intentionally decided
to build it with Perl, just to learn Perl a little. Well, it's fun, but... the
resulting code is quite cryptic :)
