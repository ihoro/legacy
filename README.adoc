# legacy

My personal nostalgia - projects and snippets since the 90s
Not everything survived and not every piece can be published.
I treat this GitHub space as another backup media.

## ays

ays - Are You Sure?
Some simple program to shutdown, reboot or log off. It was usually binded to
some special keys on my keyboard.

## df

Some data parsing tool used for implementation and work with specific navigation
hardware.  It reminds me taht NMEA standard is involved here.

## kli

kli - keyboard layout indicator.
As I remember it was the time of counting each MB of your RAM :) And I do not
remember why, but default Windows' indicator was not good enough. And some
third party software like Keyboard Ninja (is it a correct name?) was quite a
memory consumer. And such a tiny 5 KB executable was funny to have. So,
probably the key idea behind this project was learning and "why not?" :-D

## pcalc

Calculates something, but who remembers what. And it's hard to guess from that
cryptic asm code.

## rcheck

I do not remember what it does, it looks I was not intended to be its user.

## runmax

Runs a program with Win GUI window maximized.

## se

se - script executor.
Talks to specific navigation hardware via UART (COM) port, receives respective
responses and builds a report. Its primary use was navigation hardware testing.

## sleep

I guess it was used in a big project for some bat files logic.
