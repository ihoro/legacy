# legacy

My personal nostalgia - projects and snippets since the 90s

Not everything survived and not every piece can be published.
I treat this GitHub space as another backup media.


## kli

kli - keyboard layout indicator

As I remember it was the time of counting each MB of your RAM :) And I do not
remember why, but default Windows' indicator was not good enough. And some
third party software like Keyboard Ninja (is it a correct name?) was quite a
memory consumer. And such a tiny 5 KB executable was funny to have. So,
probably the key idea behind this project was learning and "why not?" :-D


## runmax

Runs a program with Win GUI window maximized
