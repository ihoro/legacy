This is really just a tip, to ward you away from a little gotcha that stumped me for a while.

When you call the function SetCellType so your own specific class is used to edit a cell. e.g. a drop down combobox or check box in a cell; you still must set your grid to be editable! Otherwise the cell remains just as it is.

So:-
// Call this first:-
pYourGrid.SetEditable(TRUE);
// then call this:-
pYourGrid.SetCellType(nRow, nCol, RUNTIME_CLASS(CGridCellCombo));

May be cool to have a little note in these docs somewhere to mention this.
